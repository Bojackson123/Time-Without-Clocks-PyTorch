This is the updated Time-Without-Clocks AI model originally made Dr. Warrick Roseboom and the Time Storm team at: https://github.com/timestorm-project/time-without-clocks

1.) Have python and pip installed and in your system's PATH.

2.) CD Into the root directory and use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for windows and "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" for lunix and macOS 
(ensure you have python and pip installed and in your system's PATH)

3.) A test video is already in the videos folder. If you would like to use your own add the video to the folder update the video_path in the Demo_Apr_2024.py script

4.) Run "python Demo_Apr_2024.py" in the terminal and after the script runs check the "output" folder for the results.
